# Tangible Landscape Immersive Extension

## Abstract
Tangible Landscape is a tangible interface for geographic information systems (GIS). It interactively couples physical and digital models of a landscape so that users can intuitively explore, model, and analyze geospatial data in a collaborative environment. Conceptually Tangible Landscape lets users hold a GIS in their hands so that they can feel the shape of the topography, naturally sculpt new landforms, and interact with simulations like water flow.
Since it only affords a bird's-eye view of the landscape, we coupled it with an immersive virtual environment so that users can virtually walk around the modeled landscape and visualize it at a human-scale. Now as users shape topography, draw trees, define viewpoints, or route a walkthrough they can see the results on the projection-augmented model, rendered on a display, or rendered on a head-mounted display.
